# Data-Analysis-Projects
Welcome to my GitHub repository featuring a diverse range of data analysis projects across Excel, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Python. Each project showcases my expertise in leveraging these tools to extract insights, visualize data, and drive informed decision-making.


###  SQL Data Analysis
In my SQL project, I concentrated on two essential phases: data cleaning and exploration. Using SQL queries, I meticulously cleaned the dataset by addressing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and eliminating duplicates. This rigorous process ensured the data was uniform and accurate, laying a solid foundation for analysis.

Following data cleaning, I employed SQL's querying capabilities to explore the dataset. This exploration phase involved querying the data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset itself. By focusing on these fundamental aspects of data preparation and analysis, the project demonstrated SQL's effectiveness in enhancing data quality and facilitating meaningful insights for decision-making processes.



## Excel 
### Overview
This repository contains two Excel projects: a Bike Sales Dashboard and a Revenue vs. Target Dashboard. Both projects utilize Excel's powerful data visualization and analysis tools to provide comprehensive insights into sales and revenue performance.

## Python Projects
### Amazon Web Scraper Project
This Python project involves web scraping Amazon product data to analyze various product metrics such as pricing, ratings, and availability. The project is divided into two main components: a Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis, which allows for interactive data visualization and initial insights, and a Python script designed for automated data extraction, which runs on a schedule to gather updated product information continuously. The script uses libraries such as BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML, requests for handling HTTP requests, and pandas for data manipulation and storage. This setup enables users to track product trends over time and make data-driven decisions based on real-time information.
